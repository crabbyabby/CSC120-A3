Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?

I consulted with Emily and Ester on this!

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?

I attended Sunday TA hours.

- What are your initial impressions of Java?

I have already coded in Java before but since it was my junior year of high school, I forgot a lot. I am remembering 
all the same differences between this and Python though!

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 

Programming seems to have very similar structures and concepts in general, however there are syntax differences and small application differences in each language that can be kind of annoying to learn.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

It was really helpful, when trying to implement an idea in Java that you may only know how to do in Python to search up how to do it before implementing and seeing the differences before trying it out. Also give yourself more time than you think you need.
